<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Electronic Engineer and Master’s Student in Data Science at Tecnológico Nacional de México, currently working 
  as an IoT Engineer</p>

<p>My professional profile uniquely integrates embedded systems engineering, IoT architectures, and advanced data science, 
  allowing me to bridge real-world hardware data acquisition with high-level analytics and intelligent decision-making systems.</p>

<p>My engineering background provides a strong technical advantage in designing solutions that integrate hardware, firmware,
   cloud connectivity, and data analytics into scalable smart systems..</p>

<p>In addition to my engineering career, I am also a Big Data Professor, teaching large-scale data processing, applied analytics, 
  and machine learning concepts. I am passionate about transforming complex technical topics into structured, practical knowledge 
  that connects theory with real-world implementation.</p>
